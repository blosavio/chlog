A <code>major.minor.patch</code> sequence of numbers simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to tell us how to make good decisions about switching versions. On the other hand, html/markdown changelogs could potentially convey that information, but require a person to read and interpret it.</p><p>Ideally, a changelog would contain a compact representation of what changed from one version to the next, and operational implications of those changes. We use functions <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, but only function <code>baz</code> changed. Safe to switch. Or, function <code>baz</code> changed and we use it, but the change is non-breaking, so, again, it's safe to switch. Or, maybe <code>baz</code> was changed in a way that does break the way we use it, but the changelog tells us why it changed and how to manage the switch.</p><p>Changelogs are often presented as <a href="https://clojure.org/releases/devchangelog"><span class="small-caps">html</span></a> or <a href="https://codeberg.org/leiningen/leiningen/raw/branch/main/resources/leiningen/new/template/CHANGELOG.md">markdown</a> files, intended for people to read. But to convey the depth of information we're talking about requires a high-level of discipline by the authors to comprehensively write all that out. Mistakes and omissions are bound to happen with free-form text, not to mention irregularities, and in the end, a person has to synthesize a lot of bits to make a decision. html/markdown is ill-suited for this purpose.</p><p>Storing a changelog in Clojure data structures offers many potential benefits. The data can be written, stored, retrieved, and manipulated programmatically. It can be <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/speculoos">validated</a> for correctness and completeness. And we could write <a href="#possibilities">utilities</a> that answer detailed questions about what it would be like to switch from one version to another.</p><p>Chlog is a library that tests these ideas. It encompasses several parts. First, it promotes a set of <a href="#ideas">ideas</a>, some of which we've already mentioned. Second, Chlog proposes a set of specifications for such a changelog. Third, Chlog offers an experimental implementation that maintains an <code>.edn</code> changelog, validates it, and generates easily-readable html and markdown webpages based upon the changelog data.</p><p>The resulting changelog looks like <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/changelog.md">this</a>.</p></section><section id="ideas"><h2>Ideas</h2><h3>A version number is just a number</h3><p>Versioning software with <code>major.minor.patch</code> numbers attempt to convey the notion <em>Yes, we can safely upgrade to such-and-such version</em>. But the granularity is poor. What if a dependency does have a breaking change, but the breaking change is in a portion of the dependency that we don't use. Version numbers ought to merely be a label to differentiate one release from another.</p><p>If a version number is merely a label without semantics, how would someone judge whether to change from one version to another? A detailed, concise, regularly-formatted changelog conveys all the information necessary to make an informed decision about if there is any benefit to change versions, if changing version will require changes to on the consuming side, and if so, what changes are necessary.</p><p>A later version is not promised to be <em>better</em>, merely different. The changelog authors will provide dispassionate information about the changes, and the people using the software can decide whether it is worth switching.</p><p>Chlog is an experiment to detangle version numbers from changelog information. A version number <code>n</code> makes no claim other than it was released some time later than version <code>n-1</code>.</p><h3>A changelog is data</h3><p>The <code>changelog.edn</code> is the single, canonical source of information. All other representations (html/markdown, etc) are derived from that and are merely conveniences.</p><p id="info">A human- and machine-readable <code>changelog.edn</code> will accompany each version. <code>changelog.edn</code> is tail-appended file constructed from all previous releases, possibly automatically-composed of per-version <code>changelog-v<em>N</em>.edn</code> files in a sub-directory.</p><h3>A low threshold for breakage</h3><p>The Chlog experiment focuses on the changelog being the sole source of information on what will happen when switching versions. For that to work, the entries must accurately communicate whether a change is breaking. Not every change can be objectively categorized as either breaking or non-breaking (more on that in a moment). To have empathy for other people is tricky. If all changes are claimed as breaking, the concept loses its meaning and purpose. But if a supposedly safe change ends up breaking for someone else, trust is lost.</p><p>Within a changelog, seeing <code>:breaking? false</code> indicates that switching to that version will work as before with zero other changes (including changes in dependencies). Otherwise, the change is a <a href="#breaking"><em>breaking change</em></a>.</p><p>As a rough starting guideline, the following kinds of changes are <strong>probably</strong> breaking.</p><ul><li>all regressions (performance, memory, network)</li><li>added or changed dependencies (see note below)</li><li>removed or renamed namespaces</li><li>moved, renamed, or removed functions</li><li>stricter input requirements</li><li>decreased return</li><li>different default</li></ul><p>Likewise, the follow kinds of changes are <strong>probably</strong> non-breaking.</p><ul><li>all improvements (performance, memory, network)</li><li>removed dependencies</li><li>added or deprecated namespaces</li><li>added or deprecated functions</li><li>relaxed input requirements</li><li>increased returns</li><li>implementation</li><li>source code formatting</li><li>documentation</li></ul><p>These are just starting guidelines. Careful judgment may say that a change in a function's defaults will in all cases be a non-breaking change. Or, a change in the documentation might be so severe that it's elevated to a breaking change.</p><p>One important kind of change that kinda defies categorization is bug-fixes. According to the notion that a non-breaking change must be a perfect drop-in replacement, a bug fix would classify as a breaking change. Tentative policy: Bug fixes are non-breaking changes, but it depends on the scenario.</p><h3>Formal specifications state required information</h3><p>Each version has required information that is explicitly delineated in the <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/src/chlog/changelog_specifications.clj">specifications</a>. Correctness of a changelog, or any sub-component of the changelog, may be verified by validating the changelog against those specifications.</p><h3>Etc.</h3><ul><li><p>A changelog is mutable. Corrections and additions are encouraged. The changelog itself is versioned-controlled data, and the html/markdown documents that are generated from the changelog data are also under version-control.</p></li><li><p>Yanked or retracted releases can simply be noted by revising the changelog data.</p></li><li><p>Much of the changelog data is objective, but some is merely the changelog author's opinions. That's okay. The changelog author is communicating that opinion to the person considering switching versions. The changelog author may consider a particular bug-fix <code>:high</code> urgency, but the person using the software may not.</p></li></ul></section><section id="usage"><h2>Usage</h2><p>There are four components to using Chlog.</p><ol><li><p>Maintain changelog data in <code>edn</code> files.</p></li><li><p><a href="#setup">Declare and require</a> the dependency.</p></li><li><p>Create an <em>options</em> file.</p></li><li><p>Generate the changelog documents.</p></li></ol><h3>Changelog information is Clojure data</h3><p>Changelog information is stored as a series of nested collections in <code>.edn</code> files. Every <a href="#version"><em>version</em></a> is represented by the following map.</p><pre><code>{:version ___
 :date {:year ___
        :month ___
        :day ___ }
 :responsible {:name ___
               :email ___ }
 :project-status ___
 :breaking? ___
 :urgency ___
 :comment ___
 :changes [...]}</code></pre><p>This map (and all the following) is formally and canonically <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/src/chlog/changelog_specifications.clj">specified</a> with a <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/speculoos">Speculoos</a> style specification.</p><p>Briefly, the version parts are:</p><ul><li><strong>version</strong> is an integer.</li><li><strong>date</strong> is a map of integer year, string month, and integer day</li><li><strong>responsible</strong> is a map of a name string and an email string.</li><li><strong>project-status</strong> is one of enumerated keywords borrowed from the <a href="https://github.com/metosin/open-source/blob/main/project-status.md"> Metosin description</a>.</li><li><strong>breaking?</strong> is a boolean or nil (only valid for the initial release).</li><li><strong>urgency</strong> is one of <code>:low</code>, <code>:medium</code>, or <code>:high</code>.</li><li><strong>comment</strong> is a free-form string.</li><li><strong>changes</strong> a vector of <em>change</em> maps (discussed soon).</li></ul><p>A <a href="#changelog">changelog</a> is a tail-appended vector of one or more such <em>version</em> hash-maps. Furthermore, a version hash-map may have zero or more <a href="#change"><em>change</em></a> hash-maps associated to the <code>:changes</code> key. A <em>change</em> hash-map looks like this.</p><pre><code>{:description ___

It also declares preferences for other optional settings.</p><p>Required keys:</p><ul><li><p><code>:copyright-holder</code> Name displayed in the copyright statement in the footer of the changelog.</p></li><li><p><code>:UUID</code> Version 4 <strong>U</strong>niversally <strong>U</strong>nique <strong>Id</strong>entifier. Suggestion: eval-and-replace <code>(random-uuid)</code>. Default <code>nil</code>.</p></li></ul><p>Optional keys:</p><ul><li><p><code>:project-name-formatted</code> Alternative project name (string) to use in preference to the project name supplied by <code>defproject</code> in the <code>project.clj</code> file.</p></li><li><p><code>:changelog-entries-directory</code> Alternative directory to find changelog <code>.edn</code> files. Include trailing '/'. Default <code>resources/changelog_entries/</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>:changelog-data-file</code> Alternative <code>.edn</code> file that contains the changelog data. May include <code>load-file</code>-ing for easier organization and version control. Default <code>changelog.edn</code>.</p></li><li><p><code>:changelog-html-directory</code> Alternative output <span class="small-caps">html</span> directory (string). Include trailing '/'. Defaults to 'doc/'.</p></li><li><p><code>:changelog-html-filename</code> Alternative output <span class="small-caps">html</span> filename (string). Defaults to 'changelog.html'.</p></li><li><p><code>:changelog-markdown-directory</code> Alternative output markdown directory (string). Include trailing `/`. Defaults to '' (i.e., project's root directory).</p></li><li><p><code>:changelog-markdown-filename</code> Alternative output markdown filename (string). Defaults to 'changelog.md'.</p></li></ul><h3>Generating the changelog documents</h3><p>The Chlog library generates <span class="small-caps">html</span> and markdown changelog files from <a href="https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">hiccup</a> source. To generate the <span class="small-caps">html</span> and markdown files. We could evaluate…</p><pre><code>(generate-all-changelogs (load-file "resources/chlog_options.edn"))</code></pre><p>…in whatever namespace we loaded <code>generate-all-changelogs</code>. Or, we could copy <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/tree/main/resources/chlog_generator.clj"><code>resources/chlog_generator.clj</code></a> and evaluate all forms in the namespace (<span class="small-caps">cider</span> command <code>C-c C-k</code>).</p><p>Chlog produces two files. The first is a 'markdown' file that's actually plain old <span class="small-caps">html</span>, abusing the fact that <span class="small-caps">html</span> passes through the markdown converter. By default, this markdown file is written to the project's root directory where GitHub can find and display the changelog. We don't need a dedicated markdown converter to view this file; copy it to a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub gist</a> and it'll display similarly to when we view it on GitHub. The second file, by default written to the <code>resources/</code> directory, is a proper <span class="small-caps">html</span> document with a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, etc., that is viewable in any browser. We may want to copy over the <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/doc/project.css">css file</a> for some minimal styling.</p></section><section id="possibilities"><h2>Possibilities</h2><p>When changelog information is stored as Clojure data, it opens many intriguing possibilities.</p><ul><li><p>Changelog data could be used to generate formatted html or markdown webpages for casual reading. Chlog currently implements this.</p></li><li><p>A <code>js/cljs</code> widget embedded in a webpage that presents a <em>current version</em> selector and a <em>target version</em> selector. Then, based on each selection, the utility would collapse all the intervening versions and list the breaking and non-breaking changes. Someone considering switching versions could quickly click around and compare the available versions. <em>Switching from version 3 to version 4 introduces one breaking change</em> whereas <em>Switching from version 3 to version 5 involves that same breaking change, plus another breaking change in a function we don't use.</em> Therefore, switching to version 4 or version 5 is equivalent.</p></li><li><p>A utility that could scan the codebase and list all the functions used from a particular dependency. If we were curious about switching versions of that dependency, that list of functions would be compared to the list of functions with breaking changes. If there was no intersection of the lists, it's safe to switch versions. If the codebase <em>did</em> use a function with a breaking change, the changelog would communicate what changed, and how involved it would be to switch versions.</p></li></ul></section><section id="critique"><h2>Critique</h2><p>On the one hand, making the changelog normalized data lends itself to straightforward anaylsis web display. On the other hand, is it a strategic mistake to require that every change be a member of an enumerated set? Is having a change-kind <code>:other</code> a red flag? It's fairly typical for one of my commits be include an update to the source code, accompanined by some additional unit tests, and some kind of change in the documentation. At the moment, I would categorize it as a <code>:altered-function</code>, with the implicit understanding that a person reading the changelog would care about that the most, and that the accompanying unit tests and docs are subordinate.</p><p>But the rigidity causes concern, and perhaps only extended use will reveal if it's a deal-breaker.</p></section><section id="alternatives"><h2>Alternatives</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Classic markdown/html files</strong> Discussed above.</p></li><li><p><strong>Changelog generated from version control commit log</strong> At first glance, a changelog generated from a version control log seems natural. It is certainly easy, and there are many concepts in common. However, the purpose of a changelog is different enough to merit its own focus.</p><p>Version control logs communicate information about the development history to developers of that software. Changelogs communicate the details of the released versions to people who consume the software. Related, but subtly different.</p><p>A commit message notes fine-grained changes to the software, somewhat like a diary of software development. It would feel a bit oppressive to have to consider how every commit message would appear in a public changelog. The evolution of software is noisy. Commit messages may involve false starts, mistakes, and dead ends. They are meant to be read by people <em>developing</em> the software itself. Plus, writing commit messages that also serve as a changelog entry would require some kind of standards or specifications, or heroic discipline by the authors. Finally, commit messages typically do not concern themselves about whether the change is breaking for the people using the software.</p><p>Changelogs, on the other hand, should clearly and concisely communicate, to people <em>using</em> the software, the differences between one version and another. It could be fine- or coarse-grained, but the freedom to decide should be independent of the version control log. Authoring a changelog requires care, judgment, and empathy for people ultimately using the software, and is a task somewhat different from wrangling version control commit messages.</p></li></ul><p>Even at this early stage of its life, Chlog can alleviate most of that labor. Keep the changelog as <code>.edn</code> data, and Chlog will take care of the html/markdown.</p></section><section id="examples"><h2>Examples</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/blosavio/speculoos/blob/main/changelog.md">Changelog</a> for a specification library.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/blosavio/fn-in/blob/master/changelog.md">Changelog</a> for a collection manipulation library.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/blosavio/readmoi/blob/main/changelog.md">Changelog</a> for a ReadMe generator library.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/changelog.md">Changelog</a> for a changelog generator library.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/resources/test_changelog/test_outputs/test_changelog.md">Changelog</a> for a fictitious library.</p></section><section id="glossary"><h2>Glossary</h2><dl><dt id="breaking">breaking</dt><dd>Any change that is not <a href="#non-breaking"><em>non-breaking</em></a>.</dd></dl><dl><dt id="changelog">changelog</dt><dd><p>A sequence of notable versions of project.
