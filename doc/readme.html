        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Q: <em>What will happen if we switch from this version to that version?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: <em>Consult the changelog, not the version number.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask too much of our software version numbers, and we should expect more from our changelogs. A <code>major.minor.patch</code> sequence of numbers
        simply doesn't have enough bandwidth to tell us how to make good decisions about switching versions. On the other hand, <span class=
        "small-caps">html</span>/markdown changelogs could potentially convey that information, but require a person to read and interpret it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, a changelog would contain a compact representation of what changed from one version to the next, and operational implications of those
        changes. If we use functions <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, but only function <code>baz</code> changed, it's safe to switch. Or, function
        <code>baz</code> changed and we use it, but the change is non-breaking, so, again, it's safe to switch. Or, maybe <code>baz</code> was changed in a way
        that <em>does</em> break the way we use it, but the changelog tells us why it changed and how to manage the switch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changelogs are often served as <a href="https://clojure.org/releases/devchangelog"><span class="small-caps">html</span></a> or <a href=
        "https://codeberg.org/leiningen/leiningen/raw/branch/main/resources/leiningen/new/template/CHANGELOG.md">markdown</a> files, intended for people to
        read. But to convey the depth of information we're talking about requires a high-level of discipline by the authors to comprehensively write all that
        out. Mistakes and omissions are bound to happen with free-form text, not to mention irregularities that thwart parsing, and in the end, a person has to
        synthesize a lot of bits to make a decision. <span class="small-caps">html</span>/markdown is ill-suited for this purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Storing a changelog in Clojure data structures offers many potential benefits. The data can be written, stored, retrieved, and manipulated
        programmatically. It can be <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/speculoos">validated</a> for correctness and completeness. And we could write <a href=
        "#possibilities">utilities</a> that answer detailed questions about what it would be like to switch from one version to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chlog is a library that tests these ideas. It encompasses several parts. First, it promotes a set of <a href="#ideas">ideas</a>, some of which we've
        already mentioned. Second, Chlog proposes a set of specifications for such a changelog. Third, Chlog offers an experimental implementation that
        maintains an <code>.edn</code> changelog specification, validates it, and generates easily-readable <span class="small-caps">html</span> and markdown
        webpages based upon the changelog data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resulting changelog looks like <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/changelog.md">this</a>.

        Ideas
      </h2>
      <h3>
        A version number is just a number
      </h3>
      <p>
        Versioning software with <code>major.minor.patch</code> numbers attempt to convey the notion <em>Yes, we can safely upgrade to such-and-such
        version</em>. But the granularity is poor. What if a dependency does have a breaking change, but the breaking change is in a portion of the dependency
        that we don't use. Version numbers ought to merely be a label to differentiate one release from another.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a version number is merely a label without semantics, how would someone judge whether to switch from one version to another? A detailed, concise,
        regularly-formatted changelog conveys all the information necessary to make an informed decision about if there is any benefit to change versions, if
        changing version will require changes to the consuming side, and if so, what changes are necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        A later version is not promised to be <em>better</em>, merely different. The changelog authors will provide dispassionate information about the
        changes, and the people using the software can decide whether it is worth switching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chlog is an experiment to detangle version numbers from changelog information. A version number <code>n</code> makes no claim other than it was
        released some time later than version <code>n-1</code>.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A changelog is data
      </h3>
      <p>
        The changelog <code>edn</code> files are the canonical sources of information. All other representations (<span class=
        "small-caps">html</span>/markdown, etc) are derived from that and are merely conveniences.
      </p>
      <p id="info">
        A human- and machine-readable <code>edn</code> file will accompany each version. The global changelog is a sequence constructed by concatenating those
        hashmaps from all previous releases, i.e., the per-version <code>changelog-v<em>N</em>.edn</code> files in a designated sub-directory.
      </p>
      <h3>
        A low threshold for breakage
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Chlog experiment focuses on the changelog being the sole source of information on what will happen when switching versions. For that to succeed,
        the entries must accurately communicate whether a change is breaking. Not every change can be objectively categorized as either breaking or
        non-breaking (more on that in a moment). To have empathy for other people is tricky. If all changes are claimed as breaking, the concept loses its
        meaning and purpose. But if a supposedly safe change ends up breaking for someone else, trust is lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a changelog, seeing <code>:breaking? false</code> declares that switching to that version will work as it worked before with zero other changes
        (including changes in dependencies). Otherwise, the change is a <a href="#breaking"><em>breaking change</em></a>, explicitly indicated by
        <code>:breaking? true</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a rough starting guideline, the following kinds of changes are <strong>probably</strong> breaking.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>all regressions (performance, memory, network)
        </li>
        <li>added or changed dependencies (see note below)
        </li>
        <li>removed or renamed namespaces
        </li>
        <li>moved, renamed, or removed functions
        </li>
        <li>stricter input requirements
        </li>
        <li>decreased return
        </li>
        <li>different default
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Likewise, the following kinds of changes are <strong>probably</strong> non-breaking.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>all improvements (performance, memory, network)
        </li>
        <li>removed dependencies
        </li>
        <li>added or deprecated namespaces
        </li>
        <li>added or deprecated functions
        </li>
        <li>relaxed input requirements
        </li>
        <li>increased returns
        </li>
        <li>implementation
        </li>
        <li>source code formatting
        </li>
        <li>documentation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are just starting guidelines. Careful judgment may say that a change in a function's defaults will in all cases be a non-breaking change. Or, a
        change in the documentation might be so severe that it's elevated to a breaking change.
      </p>
      <p>
        One important kind of change that sorta defies categorization is bug-fixes. According to the notion that a non-breaking change must be a perfect
        drop-in replacement, a bug fix would classify as a breaking change. Tentative policy: Bug fixes are non-breaking changes, but it depends on the
        scenario.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Formal specifications state required information
      </h3>
      <p>
        Each version has required information that is explicitly delineated in the <a href=
        "https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/src/chlog/changelog_specifications.clj">specifications</a>. Correctness of a changelog, or any
        sub-component of the changelog, may be verified by <a href="https://blosavio.github.io/chlog/chlog.changelog-validations.html">validating</a> the
        changelog against those specifications.
      </p>
      <h3>
        <em>Et cetera</em>
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A changelog is mutable. Corrections are encouraged and additions are okay. The changelog itself is versioned-controlled data, and the <span class=
            "small-caps">html</span>/markdown documents that are generated from the changelog data are also under version-control.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Yanked or retracted releases can simply be noted by revising the changelog data.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Much of the changelog data is objective (e.g., dates, email), but some is merely the changelog author's opinions. That's okay. The changelog author
            is communicating that opinion to the person considering switching versions. The changelog author may consider a particular bug-fix
            <code>:high</code> urgency, but the person using the software may not.

        Changelog information is Clojure data
      </h3>
      <p>
        Changelog information is built by concatenating hashmaps contained in <code>.edn</code> files located in the <a href="#entries">changelog entries
        directory</a>, one file per version. Every <a href="#version"><em>version</em></a> is represented by the following hashmap.
      </p>
      <pre><code>{:version ___
 :date {:year ___
        :month ___
        :day ___ }
 :responsible {:name ___
               :email ___ }
 :project-status ___
 :breaking? ___
 :urgency ___
 :comment ___
 :changes [...]}</code></pre>
      <p>
        This map (and all the following) is formally and canonically <a href=
        "https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/src/chlog/changelog_specifications.clj">specified</a> with a <a href=
        "https://github.com/blosavio/speculoos">Speculoos</a> style specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Briefly, the version parts are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>version</strong> is an integer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>date</strong> is a map of integer year, string month, and integer day
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>responsible</strong> is a map of a name string and an email string.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>project-status</strong> is one of enumerated keywords borrowed from the <a href=
          "https://github.com/metosin/open-source/blob/main/project-status.md">Metosin description</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>breaking?</strong> is a boolean or nil (only valid for the initial release).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>urgency</strong> is one of <code>:low</code>, <code>:medium</code>, or <code>:high</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>comment</strong> is a free-form string.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>changes</strong> is a vector of <em>change</em> maps (discussed soon).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A <a href="#changelog">changelog</a> is a tail-appended sequence of one or more such <em>version</em> hashmaps. Furthermore, a version hashmap may have
        zero or more <a href="#change"><em>change</em></a> hashmaps associated to the <code>:changes</code> key. A <em>change</em> hashmap looks like this.
      </p>
      <pre><code>{:description ___
 :reference {:source ___
             :url ___}
 :change-type ___
 :breaking? ___
 :altered-functions []
 :date {:year ___
        :month ___
        :day ___ }
 :responsible {:name ___
               :email ___ }}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Besides a sequence of <code>:altered-functions</code>, a change may contain sequences of <code>:added-functions</code>,
        <code>:deprecated-functions</code>, <code>:moved-functions</code>, <code>:removed-functions</code>, and <code>:renamed-functions</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The parts of a change hashmap are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>date</strong> analogous to the date of a version.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>reference</strong> a map of source string, optional url string, optional ticket string/uuid.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>breaking?</strong> a boolean.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>altered-functions</strong> a vector of symbols that were altered in this change.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>responsible</strong> a hashmap of a name string and an email string.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>change-type</strong> a keyword from an <a href=
          "https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/2304b2e780c23d7094872b0c58bf6a94277c77d2/src/chlog/changelog_specifications.clj#L43">enumerated list</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>description</strong> a a free-form string.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The changelog data may be manipulated and queried with any suitable Clojure function, such as <code>get-in</code>, <code>assoc-in</code>,
        <code>update-in</code>, etc. Chlog includes specifications for changelog data and utilities for performing those validations, but any validation
        facility, such as <code>clojure.spec.alpha</code>, may be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Chlog consults <em>every</em> file in the changelog entries directory that begins with <code>changelog_v</code> and ends with <code>.edn</code>.
        Between those required bookends, files may be named according to whatever may be convienient, e.g., integers padded with zeros for human-readable
        sorting in the local filesystem or desktop environment.

        "https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup">hiccup</a> source. To generate the <span class="small-caps">html</span> and markdown files. We could evaluateâ€¦
      </p>
      <pre><code>(-main "resources/chlog_options.edn")</code></pre>
      <p>
        â€¦in our <span class="small-caps">repl</span>-attached editor. Or, we run the <code>-main</code> function from command line something like this.
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ lein run -m chlog.core</code></pre>
      <p>
        Chlog produces two files. The first is a 'markdown' file that's actually plain old <span class="small-caps">html</span>, abusing the fact that
        <span class="small-caps">html</span> passes through the markdown converter. By default, this markdown file is written to the project's root directory
        where GitHub can find and display the changelog. We don't need a dedicated markdown converter to view this file; copy it to a <a href=
        "https://gist.github.com/">GitHub gist</a> and it'll display similarly to when we view it on GitHub. The second file, by default written to the
        <code>resources/</code> directory, is a proper <span class="small-caps">html</span> document with a <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, etc., that is viewable
        in any browser. We may want to copy over the <a href="https://github.com/blosavio/chlog/blob/main/doc/project.css">css file</a> for some light styling.

        Possibilities

      <p>
        When changelog information is stored as Clojure data, it opens many intriguing possibilities.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Changelog data could be used to generate formatted <span class="small-caps">html</span> or markdown webpages for casual reading. Chlog currently
            implements this.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A <code>js/cljs</code> widget embedded in a webpage that presents a <em>current version</em> selector and a <em>target version</em> selector. Then,
            based on each selection, the utility would collapse all the intervening versions and list the breaking and non-breaking changes. Someone
            considering switching versions could quickly click around and compare the available versions. <em>Switching from version 3 to version 4 introduces
            one breaking change</em> whereas <em>Switching from version 3 to version 5 involves that same breaking change, plus another breaking change in a
            function we don't use.</em> Therefore, switching to version 4 or version 5 is equivalent.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A utility that could scan the codebase and list all the functions used from a particular dependency. If we were curious about switching versions of
            that dependency, that list of functions would be compared to the list of functions with breaking changes. If there was no intersection of the
            lists, it's safe to switch versions. If the codebase <em>did</em> use a function with a breaking change, the changelog would communicate what
            changed, and how involved it would be to switch versions.
          </p>

        Critique
      </h2>
      <p>
        On the one hand, making the changelog normalized data lends itself to straightforward analysis and display on the web. On the other hand, is it a
        strategic mistake to require that every change be a member of an enumerated set? Is having a change-kind <code>:other</code> a red flag? It's fairly
        typical for one of my commits be include an update to the source code, accompanied by some additional unit tests, and some kind of change in the
        documentation. At the moment, I would categorize it as a <code>:altered-function</code>, with the implicit understanding that a person reading the
        changelog would care about that the most, and that the accompanying unit tests and docs are subordinate.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the rigidity causes concern, and perhaps only extended use will reveal if it's a deal-breaker.

            <strong>Changelog generated from version control commit log</strong> At first glance, a changelog generated from a version control commit log seems
            natural. It is certainly easy, and there are many concepts in common. However, the purpose of a changelog is different enough to merit its own
            focus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Version control logs communicate information about the development history to developers of that software. Changelogs communicate the details of
            the released versions to people who consume the software. Related, but subtly different.
          </p>
          <p>
            A commit message notes fine-grained changes to the software, somewhat like a diary of software development. It would feel a bit oppressive to have
            to consider how every commit message would appear in a public changelog. The evolution of software is noisy. Commit messages may involve false
            starts, mistakes, and dead ends. They are meant to be read by people <em>developing</em> the software itself. Plus, writing commit messages that
            also serve as a changelog entry would require some kind of standards or specifications, or heroic discipline by the authors. Finally, commit
            messages typically do not concern themselves about whether the change is breaking for the people using the software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changelogs, on the other hand, should clearly and concisely communicate, to people <em>using</em> the software, the differences between one version
            and another. It could be fine- or coarse-grained, but the freedom to decide should be independent of the version control commit log. Authoring a
            changelog requires care, judgment, and empathy for people ultimately using the software, and is a task somewhat different from wrangling version
            control commit messages.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even at this early stage of its life, Chlog can alleviate most of that labor. Keep the changelog as <code>.edn</code> data, and Chlog will take care of
        the <span class="small-caps">html</span>/markdown.
